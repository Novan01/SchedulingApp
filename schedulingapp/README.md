## The Project

This is our scheduling app that is supposed to help a user create and schedule their events and tasks through a calendar view. We have built this project using java and SQL.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Information on the Project
Currently, not all aspects of the project work
Use Cases that have been created
Calendar View - file called calendarView.java
Create Event objects and view - files Event.java, EventController.java, CreateEventView.java
Create user login - Login.java, SQLConnection.java
Create user object - User.java

## What doesnt work
When creating an event, the event does not get sent to the SQL database and pressing Save will crash the application
When logging in, the SQL database of users does not work yet so no login attempts can fully be accessed
Selecting a day and creating an event on that day results in a parsing error
